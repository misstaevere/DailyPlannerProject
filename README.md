### Practical Project Specification: Hobby Web Application (HWA)

The application is a Daily Planner where a user is able to: 

* Save their username and password to the database
* Create a new task by entering a task date, time, name and location
* View all the tasks
* Edit a task
* Remove a task

##### The deliverable:

1. I created a Jira board with full expansion on user stories and tasks needed to complete the project.
2. I set up a remote database on MySQL Workbench and made sure the ERD for the project was present in the root of the project repository.
3. I then also hard coded SQL CRUD statements for tasks and users and made sure they worked as expected.
4. Sensible package structure in the front and back-end
5. Added a method to take in user input and send the information to the database.
6. CRUD functionality following the Enterprise Architecture Model.
7. Adherence to best practice (e.g. OOP principles, SOLID, refactoring)
8. Unit and integration testing for the project back-end.
9. Integration testing for the project front-end.
10. I have reports for tests in the root of the project repository.

Finally I have a running, working and tested application which takes in user input and can create, read, update and delete tasks in the Daily Planner.
